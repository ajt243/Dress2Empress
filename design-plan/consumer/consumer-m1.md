# Project 3, Milestone 1: **Consumer** Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](../design-journey.md)

## _Cohesive_ Audience
> Briefly explain your site's **consumer** audience.
> Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific.

The site's consumer audience comprises young adults aged 18-35, predominantly female, who are seeking fashion inspiration. This group can be divided into two subgroups of those who are completely new to fashion and don't know where to start, as well as those who are familiar with fashion but are seeking fresh ideas.

> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

This audience is cohesive because they share a common interest in fashion inspiration, regardless of their level of expertise or experience in the fashion world. Whether they're beginners or seasoned fashion enthusiasts, they are united by their desire to discover new styles and trends.


## Audience Goals
> Document your **consumer** audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need
> enough to do the job (Hint: It's at least 1, but probably no more than 3).

Goal 1: Discover new fashion trends and styles to incorporate into their wardrobe.

Goal 2: Save favorite fashion looks for later

Goal 3: Filter through looks based on their needs/preferences rather than going through the entire catelog.

## Persona
> Use the goals you identified to develop a persona of your site's **consumer** audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona.
> Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
