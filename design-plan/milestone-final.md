[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


## Milestone 3 Team Feedback Revisions
> Explain what your **team** collectively revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

We did not make any changes as we did not lose any points for the team implementation.


## Collective Implementation
> Explain how your team **collectively** implemented sessions and user access controls. (1-2 sentences)
> If one person did not contribute, simply state that.

We collectively implemented sessions by having one person implemented the login.php partial and having the other person implement the conditionals. We worked through both parts together, but one person was in charge of coding each.
