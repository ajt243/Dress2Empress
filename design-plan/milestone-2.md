[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what your team revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

We revised our designs to include filtering on the home and admin pages. Additionally, we fixed our queries so that when retrivieng all entries it does not use a JOIN clause.
