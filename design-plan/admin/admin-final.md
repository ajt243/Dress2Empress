## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment.
> How have you improved from projects 1 and 2?
> What would you do differently next time? (1-2 sentences)

I learned so much about using SQL queries and databases in a complex manner with conditionals to show or hide certain elements of my page unless certain criteria are met. I also learned how much goes into implementing login features in a secure manner to protect your site as well as your audience.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-2 sentences)

I started this class with faairly minimal knowledge of serder side rendered site, but through these threee projects I have learned exactly how important and game changing it can be for creating powerful and efficient websites. I never understood the backend aspect of coding but this has given me so much insight.
