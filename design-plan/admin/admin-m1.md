## _Cohesive_ Audience
> Briefly explain your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific.

Moderators for the website who are in charge of regualating posts and ensureing the wellbeing of the page and the data presented.

> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

This group is cohesive because all members share the common responsibilities of overseeing content quality, updating information, and ensuring the smooth operation of the site's functionalities, such as user management and content moderation.

## Audience Goals
> Document your **administrator** audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need
> enough to do the job (Hint: It's at least 1, but probably no more than 3).

Goal 1: Viewing on a admin only page

Goal 2: Editing entries, editing entries, and editing tags

Goal 3: filtering by a tag

Goal 4: logging in and out




## Persona
> Use the goals you identified to develop a persona of your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona.
> Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
